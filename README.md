**`Backend Developer (JavaScript/PHP/MySql)`**

I'm a backend software developer who loves working with JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. My thing is connecting systems using APIs, creating smooth digital ecosystems. On top of that, I enjoy dabbling with AI through API to make things more efficient and give users smarter experiences. I approach my work by tackling challenges, solving tricky problems, and always looking for cool new ideas, all while keeping up with the ever-changing tech scene.
